        <h1> Celtics and Knicks </h1>

      </body>

      <p>
        1. Celtics and Knicks are the only teams to have never moved
        Throughout NBA history, teams have consistently relocated depending on the needs of players and spectator
        numbers. To
        save money, some teams even share training bases with other local teams in order to make use of the available
        resources. That is why itâ€™s even more impressive that the Celtics and Knicks are the only teams to have never
        moved. The Celtics franshise was created June 6, 1946 and the Knicks were created in 1949 thats almost 70 years
        ago!
